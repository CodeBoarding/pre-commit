## Component Details



This component is central to how `pre-commit` manages its operational parameters and the external code repositories it interacts with. It ensures that the application's behavior is consistent, validated, and efficiently handles the lifecycle of cached repositories.



### Configuration Schema & Validation

Defines and validates the structure and content of the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `manifest.yaml` files. It includes checks for hook definitions, language types, and pre-commit version compatibility. It also handles the migration of deprecated stage names.

### YAML Parser

Provides robust functionality for loading and dumping YAML data, specifically tailored for `pre-commit`'s configuration files. It handles various YAML-related operations, including safe loading and error handling during parsing.

### YAML Rewriter

Facilitates in-place modifications and updates to YAML files, particularly the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. This is essential for operations like `autoupdate` or `migrate-config`, allowing `pre-commit` to programmatically adjust the user's configuration while preserving comments and formatting.

### Repository Store

Manages the local cache of pre-commit repositories. This includes operations for initializing, cloning, and retrieving repositories, as well as garbage collection to manage disk space. It acts as a persistent storage mechanism for the cloned repositories.

### Repository Management

Encapsulates the logic for interacting with individual pre-commit repositories. This includes cloning, checking out specific revisions, and managing the repository's internal state and manifest. It bridges the gap between the abstract concept of a repository and its physical representation on disk.
